What tools do i use?
I use VS-Code , Unity , GIMP , Audacity and Bosca Ceoil for game dev.
- [VS-Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a very good and light-weight ide with awesome auto-completion.
- [Unity](https://unity3d.com)  is an awesome game-engine with so many cool features and uses C# code to compile and make games.
- [GIMP](https://gimp.org) is an amazing software for creating sprites and exporting them.
- [Audacity](https://audacityteam.org) is usefull for sound effects.
- [Bosca Ceoil](https://boscaceoil.net) is an awesome tool for music creation.
